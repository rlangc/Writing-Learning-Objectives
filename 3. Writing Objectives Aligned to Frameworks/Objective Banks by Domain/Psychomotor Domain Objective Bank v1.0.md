# Psychomotor Domain Objective Bank (Based on Dave’s Taxonomy)

## Overview

The **Psychomotor Domain** focuses on physical movement, coordination, motor skills, and the use of tools or technology. It is essential for training that involves hands-on activities, technical skills, procedures, and demonstrations.

This bank is structured using **Dave’s Taxonomy**, which includes five progressive levels of psychomotor skill acquisition. For each level, you'll find:
- A brief description
- Common action verbs
- Sample learning objectives

Use this bank when designing skill-based learning experiences in fields like healthcare, engineering, law enforcement, manufacturing, IT, and compliance training.

## 1. Imitation
**Definition:** Learners observe and replicate an action with guidance.

**Common Verbs:** Imitate, Follow, Duplicate, Copy, Observe, Reproduce

**Objective Examples:**
- Learners will imitate the instructor's demonstration of CPR on a training manikin.
- Learners will follow a sample format to recreate a digital file directory.
- Learners will replicate the lockout/tagout safety procedure as observed in the training video.

---

## 2. Manipulation
**Definition:** Learners perform an action with some proficiency following instruction or memory.

**Common Verbs:** Perform, Execute, Assemble, Construct, Complete, Implement

**Objective Examples:**
- Learners will assemble a basic circuit using a breadboard and resistor components.
- Learners will perform the correct sequence for operating a 3D printer based on the checklist provided.
- Learners will complete a mock patient intake form using the provided EHR system template.

---

## 3. Precision
**Definition:** Learners perform tasks with accuracy and minimal errors.

**Common Verbs:** Calibrate, Measure, Align, Adjust, Tune, Operate

**Objective Examples:**
- Learners will calibrate a digital thermometer with ±0.5°C accuracy.
- Learners will operate a hydraulic press with no errors during a 10-minute drill.
- Learners will measure and cut wiring for network setup within a 1mm tolerance.

---

## 4. Articulation
**Definition:** Learners combine multiple skills to perform coordinated, efficient actions.

**Common Verbs:** Integrate, Coordinate, Customize, Adapt, Sequence

**Objective Examples:**
- Learners will integrate safety checks into a forklift operation sequence without a written guide.
- Learners will adapt a standard machine setup procedure to meet unique material specifications.
- Learners will coordinate screen sharing, annotation, and audio tools during a live Zoom training.

---

## 5. Naturalization
**Definition:** Learners perform tasks automatically, with high efficiency and innovation.

**Common Verbs:** Design, Innovate, Master, Perform Fluently, Troubleshoot, Automate

**Objective Examples:**
- Learners will troubleshoot a network failure scenario and restore connectivity under 5 minutes.
- Learners will perform an emergency shutdown of industrial equipment with no guidance.
- Learners will design and execute a custom automation macro in Microsoft Excel for data validation.

## Use Cases for the Psychomotor Domain

- **Technical Certifications**
- **Compliance Procedures (e.g., OSHA, HIPAA)**
- **Workplace Operations Training**
- **Medical Skills & Simulation Labs**
- **Software & Systems Walkthroughs**

---

## Tips for Use

- Align the **task complexity** with the learner’s experience level.
- Pair psychomotor objectives with **cognitive objectives** to ensure knowledge supports action.
- Consider adding **conditions** (tools, time constraints) and **degree** (accuracy, efficiency) using the **ABCD Model**.
