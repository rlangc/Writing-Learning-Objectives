# Guide to Using the SOLO Taxonomy for Writing Learning Objectives

## Introduction

The SOLO Taxonomy (Structure of the Observed Learning Outcome), developed by John Biggs and Kevin Collis, offers a powerful model for assessing and designing learning outcomes based on their complexity. Unlike Bloom’s Taxonomy, which categorizes types of thinking, SOLO focuses on the **quality and depth of learners' understanding**. It provides a clear progression from surface to deep learning, making it especially useful for outcome-based design and objective scaffolding.

## Why Use SOLO Taxonomy?

- Supports **progressive learning design** from basic to extended understanding
- Encourages a **focus on depth of learning**, not just types of tasks
- Helps in **designing assessments** that align with stages of student development
- Complements Bloom’s Taxonomy by focusing on the **structure** of responses

## The Five SOLO Levels

SOLO describes five levels of learner understanding, each representing a deeper and more integrated grasp of content:

| Level             | Description                                                 | Learner Response Characteristics                      |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Prestructural     | No real understanding; irrelevant or missing information    | "I don’t know." / Incorrect or unrelated response      |
| Unistructural      | One relevant idea identified                                | "Photosynthesis is about light."                      |
| Multistructural    | Several relevant ideas but not connected                   | "Photosynthesis involves light, carbon dioxide, and water." |
| Relational         | Integrated understanding; connections are made             | "Photosynthesis is how plants use sunlight, CO₂, and water to create energy." |
| Extended Abstract  | Beyond the topic; generalizes or theorizes                | "Photosynthesis exemplifies how living systems adapt to their environment." |

## SOLO in Action: Writing Learning Objectives by Level

Each level of the taxonomy can be used to scaffold learning objectives and outcomes. Below is guidance for writing objectives at each SOLO level:

### 1. **Prestructural**
**Focus:** Learner is not yet engaged or lacks foundational knowledge.

**Use Case:** Rarely used in objective writing; serves as a diagnostic stage.

**Objective Example:**  
- *"Learners will attempt to recall components of the water cycle."* (Pre-assessment only)

### 2. **Unistructural**
**Focus:** Learner can focus on a single relevant aspect.

**Objective Example:**  
- *"Learners will define the term 'ecosystem'."*  
- *"Learners will identify the main function of the CPU in a computer system."*

**Keywords:** Define, Identify, Label, Name, Recognize

### 3. **Multistructural**
**Focus:** Learner can recall or describe several relevant elements but treats them separately.

**Objective Example:**  
- *"Learners will list the key components of a networked system and describe their individual functions."*  
- *"Learners will summarize three reasons for employee turnover."*

**Keywords:** Describe, List, Outline, Categorize, Sequence

### 4. **Relational**
**Focus:** Learner integrates and links multiple ideas into a coherent whole.

**Objective Example:**  
- *"Learners will compare the structure of plant and animal cells and explain how their differences support specific biological functions."*  
- *"Learners will evaluate a training needs analysis and identify connections between data collection methods and design decisions."*

**Keywords:** Explain, Integrate, Compare, Analyze, Apply, Justify

### 5. **Extended Abstract**
**Focus:** Learner can generalize to broader contexts or create new understanding.

**Objective Example:**  
- *"Learners will design a new instructional model that applies learning theories to emerging technology contexts."*  
- *"Learners will critique two learning taxonomies and propose a hybrid model for modern workforce development."*

**Keywords:** Hypothesize, Predict, Theorize, Design, Reflect, Generate

## SOLO vs. Bloom’s: A Complementary View

| Focus                | SOLO Taxonomy                           | Bloom’s Taxonomy                        |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Core Idea           | Structure and depth of understanding     | Type of cognitive process               |
| Progression         | Surface → Deep → Abstract understanding  | Lower-order → Higher-order thinking     |
| Common Use          | Assessment design and learner analysis   | Objective writing and course planning   |
| Outcome Focused?    | Yes                                       | Yes                                     |

**Instructional Tip:**  
Use SOLO when you're designing **learning progressions**, and Bloom’s when you’re defining **task types** and **cognitive demand**. Together, they create a full-spectrum framework for learning design.

## Practical Applications in Instructional Design

- **Formative Assessments:** Track learner movement from surface to deep understanding.
- **Learning Objectives:** Scaffold objectives in a logical developmental sequence.
- **Rubric Development:** Align performance criteria with SOLO levels.
- **Curriculum Mapping:** Ensure balance between surface knowledge and extended abstract reasoning.

| Module | Objective                                                                 | SOLO Level         |

| 2      | List common data privacy threats in cloud environments.                   | Multistructural     |
| 3      | Analyze how a breach occurred in a real-world case study.                 | Relational          |
| 4      | Design a privacy training outline for a remote workforce.                 | Extended Abstract   |

## Conclusion

The SOLO Taxonomy equips instructional designers with a lens to assess not just what learners know, but **how deeply** they understand. By structuring learning objectives around increasing levels of complexity and integration, SOLO helps create experiences that move beyond rote memorization to meaningful knowledge construction and transfer.

Pairing SOLO with other design models enhances the **intentionality, progression, and assessment** of learning across disciplines and delivery formats.
