# Law Enforcement Task-to-Objective Matrix

This matrix maps training tasks to specific learning objectives to ensure alignment with agency goals, operational readiness, and compliance standards.

**Note:** "X" indicates the training task supports or evaluates the specified objective.

## Design Overview

The Task-to-Objective Matrix was developed using a backward design approach, beginning with clearly defined learning objectives that align with core law enforcement competencies, agency policies, and legal mandates. Each objective reflects a critical skill or knowledge area required for operational readiness, officer safety, and procedural compliance.

Tasks were then selected based on their ability to authentically measure or reinforce those objectives across multiple training modalities, including classroom instruction, scenario-based learning, written assessments, and field application. The matrix ensures that each task serves a purposeful role in supporting performance outcomes, minimizing redundancy, and maintaining comprehensive coverage of required competencies.

The design process involved input from subject matter experts, training officers, and legal advisors to ensure both instructional effectiveness and regulatory alignment.
