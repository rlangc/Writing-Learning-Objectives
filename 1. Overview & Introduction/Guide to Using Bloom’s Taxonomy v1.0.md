# Guide to Using Bloom’s Taxonomy for Writing Learning Objectives

## Introduction

Bloom’s Taxonomy is a foundational framework in instructional design, providing a structured hierarchy of cognitive skills that supports the development of clear, measurable learning objectives. Originally developed by Benjamin Bloom and later revised, the taxonomy helps designers ensure that instruction targets the appropriate level of complexity and aligns with desired outcomes.

This guide explores how to use Bloom’s Taxonomy to write effective learning objectives across all cognitive levels, with verb lists, writing tips, and application strategies.

## Why Use Bloom’s Taxonomy?

- Ensures cognitive alignment between objectives, instruction, and assessment
- Supports scaffolding of content from simple to complex tasks
- Helps avoid vague, unmeasurable language in objectives
- Encourages higher-order thinking and problem-solving

## The Revised Bloom’s Taxonomy (2001)

The original taxonomy (1956) used nouns to classify levels of thinking. The **revised taxonomy** by Anderson & Krathwohl uses **verbs** to reflect the active nature of learning. The six cognitive levels are:

| Level        | Description                                 | Example Verbs                                 |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Remember     | Recall facts and basic concepts             | Define, List, Identify, Name, Label            |
| Understand   | Explain ideas or concepts                   | Summarize, Interpret, Explain, Classify        |
| Apply        | Use information in new situations           | Implement, Execute, Use, Demonstrate           |
| Analyze      | Break down into parts; identify relationships | Compare, Differentiate, Organize, Deconstruct  |
| Evaluate     | Justify a decision or stance                | Judge, Critique, Recommend, Validate           |
| Create       | Produce new or original work                | Design, Build, Develop, Formulate              |

## Bloom’s in Action: Writing Learning Objectives by Level

Each objective should include:
- **Action Verb** (based on Bloom’s level)
- **Content** (what the learner will learn)
- **Condition** (optional, the context or scenario)
- **Criteria** (optional, how success will be measured)

### 1. **Remember**
Focus: Recognizing or recalling information

**Example Objective:**
- *"Learners will list the five stages of team development."*

**Common Verbs:** Identify, Recall, Define, Match, Name

### 2. **Understand**
Focus: Interpreting, summarizing, or explaining concepts

**Example Objective:**
- *"Learners will summarize the purpose of a project charter in their own words."*

**Common Verbs:** Explain, Classify, Describe, Discuss, Interpret

### 3. **Apply**
Focus: Using knowledge in new ways or practical settings

**Example Objective:**
- *"Given a client scenario, learners will apply conflict resolution techniques to suggest an appropriate intervention strategy."*

**Common Verbs:** Use, Implement, Perform, Solve, Execute

### 4. **Analyze**
Focus: Distinguishing between parts, understanding structure

**Example Objective:**
- *"Learners will analyze a training program to identify gaps between objectives and assessment methods."*

**Common Verbs:** Differentiate, Examine, Organize, Deconstruct

### 5. **Evaluate**
Focus: Making judgments based on criteria

**Example Objective:**
- *"Learners will critique three proposed solutions and recommend the most effective based on ROI analysis."*

**Common Verbs:** Evaluate, Justify, Support, Recommend, Critique

### 6. **Create**
Focus: Producing new or original work

**Example Objective:**
- *"Learners will design a storyboard for an eLearning module that incorporates multimedia, interaction, and assessment aligned with the course objectives."*

**Common Verbs:** Design, Construct, Build, Compose, Plan

## Tips for Using Bloom’s Effectively

- **Start with your assessment in mind**: What must learners demonstrate?
- **Avoid vague verbs**: “Understand,” “Know,” or “Learn” are not observable or measurable unless clarified.
- **Sequence objectives from lower to higher levels** where appropriate.
- **Combine levels** in complex tasks (e.g., "Analyze and create...").
- **Match verbs with domain complexity** and learner experience.

## Sample Bloom’s-Aligned Learning Path

| Module | Objective                                         | Bloom’s Level |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| 1      | Identify components of a learning objective       | Remember       |
| 2      | Explain the purpose of the ABCD model             | Understand     |
| 3      | Apply the ABCD model to write sample objectives   | Apply          |
| 4      | Analyze poorly written objectives for weaknesses  | Analyze        |
| 5      | Evaluate a course for objective alignment         | Evaluate       |
| 6      | Design a new objective-driven training module     | Create         |

## Conclusion

Using Bloom’s Taxonomy empowers instructional designers to craft clear, structured, and developmentally appropriate learning objectives. It brings consistency and depth to instructional planning and ensures alignment between what’s taught, how it’s taught, and how it’s assessed.

By mastering this framework, you’ll elevate the quality and clarity of your learning design across all domains.
